# A HTML 5 attempt of writing solitaire

> build Badge here 

This is a HTML 5 Application of Solitaire. This is mainly for personal development and
learning.

At the moment there are no build processes. Just load `index.html` into the browser and
the application should start.

## Addtional information

I have tried to modulise the application so we can load and unload parts of the application
so the code can be reusuable.

> Utilities.Collections.LinkList is able to be reused in other applications
